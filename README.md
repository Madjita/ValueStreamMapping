# ValueStreamMapping
Value-stream mapping, also known as "material- and information-flow mapping",[1] is a lean-management method for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from the beginning of the specific process until it reaches the customer. A value stream map is a visual tool that displays all critical steps in a specific process and easily quantifies the time and volume taken at each stage.[citation needed][2] Value stream maps show the flow of both materials and information as they progress through the process.[3]
